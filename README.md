# Our Software Principles

## Motivation

At our bi-annual tech summit, held in Fall of 2016, we identified that our organization lacked consistent principles at the foundation of our decisions and interactions. As a result, we realized that we did not have enough:

* Direct challenges of decisions and ideas - especially those communicated from higher up
* Passionate pursuit of organic initiatives that impact our users

*Steve Huffman - CEO of Reddit - says it best: "Values are a tool for making decisions". If we achieve a strong belief in our values, then they can guide our everyday decisions within our work; within our daily interactions; and influence how we think about our users.*

**Our tech organization unanimously decided that we needed to establish core values for our technology organization.**

## The Process

Our goal was: Define the tech org's values through an inclusive, collaborative process.

We did this in 3 steps:

1. Collect as many ideas as possible from as many people as possible
2. Through grouping similar ideas and a series of discussions and polls, we'll narrow the larger pool down to smaller one.
3. Crunch these down into our final, beautifully articulated values through a TBD process.

Further validation that we were onto a good thing came when, independent of our efforts, our company's Executive team identified the need to establish company wide values.

We decided to continue our efforts in parallel, and at the end of it compare our results with those of the broader company, with 1 of 3 eventual outcomes:

1. Combine our values with those of the company
2. Scrap ours altogether
3. Have ours live as children of the company values, with a very tech specific flavor.

## Tech and Company Values
After a thorough effort, where we:

1. Collected more than 100 ideas from across the tech org
2. Grouped these and drafted them as values in 6 independent efforts
3. Took the best of these to form our final values and then associated tech specific tactics with them,

We quite incredibly came up with a set of values that were remarkably similar to those of the company. While the wording and number of values was different, the values instilled in each were much the same. Take a look:

* [a relative link](TECHVALUES.md)
* [a relative link](COMPANYVALUES.md)


## The Outcome
Because of the similarities between the tech values and the company values, we concluded that we should still keep ours as a reference; but align our tech specific tactics that we had originally defined as part of our values, with the company values. 

We believe that living by the company values; and coupling them with tech specific operational items as well as examples of how to apply the values and tactics within the tech org, serves as a strong foundation for guiding our decisions and initiatives.

**LOVE OUR USERS**  

* Write user stories that voice the problem we are trying to solve from the users’ perspective
* Gather data to make decisions using analytics and user testing; allow this data to challenge any preconceived notions
* Keep the context of our industry relevant by continuously reminding ourselves who our users are
* Be considerate of those with special needs that are interacting with our products through an accessibility device
* Recognize the diversity that exists in our user groups who need our tools to be relevant to them

**DO THE RIGHT THING**  

* Be a role model: allow your embodiment of these attributes to rub off on others
* Be considerate of your colleagues that will be supporting your solutions now and in the future

* Have team retros after every sprint to reflect on strengths and possible areas of improvement

**DEBATE IT** 
 
* Ask 5 Why’s to ensure our KPIs are solving a real user problem

* Know how to disagree; criticize the idea, not the person

**OWN YOUR OUTCOMES**  

* Use available forums to ensure your voice is heard
* Take action; Found an issue with our deploy strategy? Propose a plan to fix it! Found a bug in the code as you were implementing a feature? Write a story for it!
* Leave everything better than it was found. If you can make it better in 5 minutes, do it. If you can't, follow up."
* Break down complex problems into smaller, bite-sized pieces; participate in Inceptions and IPMs
* Define SMART goals at the individual, team and company level

* Challenge existing patterns as the best solution might be an alternative approach
* Have a growth mindset; be a self-motivated learner
* Give praise and constructive criticism to help your teammates grow
* Protect spaces for creative development and growth, such as 10% time and biannual Hackathons
* Promote knowledge-sharing through guild meetings, the Mentorship program and XOIT workshops
* Contribute to the open source community
* Share your learnings with the greater tech community
* Write about your experiences and publish them
